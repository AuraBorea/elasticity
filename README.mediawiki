= Elasticity =

Elasticity provides programmatic access to Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce service.

There are five API actions in the [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html EMR API], described below.  Please see the Amazon guide for details on these operations because the default values aren't obvious (e.g. the meaning of DescribeJobFlows without parameters).

'''NOTE''': The AWS plumbing (especially signing/authentication) was used from [http://www.rightscale.com/ RightScale's] amazing [https://github.com/rightscale/right_aws right_aws gem] which works extraordinarily well!
